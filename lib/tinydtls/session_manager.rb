module TinyDTLS
  # This class is used to manage established tinydtls sessions. It
  # stores instances of the TinyDTLS::Session class.
  #
  # While memory allocated for sessions is automatically freed by
  # tinydtls, if it receive an alert from the peer associated with that
  # session, memory isn't freed if the peer doesn't send an alert.
  # Therefore this class starts a background thread automatically
  # freeing memory associated with sessions which haven't been used
  # since a specified duration.

    # within `timeout * 2` seconds it will be freed automatically.

    # pointer is required to free sessions in the background thread.
