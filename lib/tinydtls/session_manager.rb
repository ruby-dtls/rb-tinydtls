module TinyDTLS
  # This class is used to manage established tinydtls sessions. It

  # tinydtls, if it receive an alert from the peer associated with that
  # session, memory isn't freed if the peer doesn't send an alert.
  # Therefore this class starts a background thread automatically
  # freeing memory associated with sessions which haven't been used
  # since a specified duration.
